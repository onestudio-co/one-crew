# Prompt Engineering for Venture Workshop

This document outlines the process of creating the Venture Monetization Workshop application using AI assistance (Claude and ChatGPT). It serves as a guide for those interested in understanding how AI can be leveraged for complex application development.

## Origin Story

The Venture Monetization Workshop concept originated from a real-world workshop conducted with employees that lasted over 3 hours. After reviewing the results, we decided to explore how AI could streamline and enhance this process.

### Initial ChatGPT Exploration

The journey began by sharing a PNG image of our MIRO board from the original workshop with ChatGPT. This visual representation provided crucial context about the workshop structure, flow, and outcomes. With this foundation in place, we then proceeded with a series of prompts to ChatGPT, starting with:

```
Please give me a prompt to repeat the workshop again, give me the Venture Description (without revenue stream) and the list of questions and outcomes needed from each workshop step.
Make the Detail Realistic Streams three steps as the original worksop advice

generate the detailed 10 first
Monthly revenue potential second with evidance / notes
Monthly expense with evidance / notes

Give me a detailed prompt to give it to a Multi-agentic model to conduct such a workshop.
```

After receiving initial results, we provided feedback from our management team:

```
Our human in the loop comittee have several comments on the outcomes

1) Many revenue streams are duplicated or similar
2) Some revenue streams are not applicable
3) The responses are quite optimistic, while the startup building is so hard
4) We are a Venture Builder with go/no go gates, we only fund the ventures with $50K to validate then $250K as pre-seed, and we need to kill ideas if not working with our model. the same for the revenue stream, we can't work on someinh that need a big cost.
5) Our startups work in MENA, many of them are GCC centric, the numbers must be relastic for this market.

Can you please enhance the prompt to take this into considration?
```

### The Master Prompt

This iterative process led to the creation of our master prompt for the workshop system:

```
You are a multi‑agentic workshop system designed to run a rigorous, stage‑gated monetization workshop for an early‑stage venture in the GCC/MENA region. Follow these six steps, incorporating the constraints below.

**Context & Constraints**
- Stage‑gate funding model: up to $50 K for initial validation, then up to $250 K for pre‑seed.
- Discard any revenue stream that requires > $50 K upfront or > $5 K/month OPEX to validate.
- Use conservative, realistic benchmarks for GCC/MENA markets.
- Ensure all streams are unique, directly applicable to the venture's business model, and feasible at this stage.

---

## Workshop Steps

**1. Define Venture Description**
- **Agent:** Definition Agent
- **Task:** Craft a one‑sentence value proposition and a one‑paragraph description (no revenue details).

**2. Generate High‑Level Streams**
- **Agent:** Ideation Agent
- **Task:** List 20 distinct, non‑overlapping monetization options that suit a digital‑first business in GCC/MENA.

**3. Detail Realistic Streams**
- **3.1 Stream Ideation Agent:**
  • Select 10 of the above streams that each require ≤ $50 K total build cost.
  • Provide name + 1–2‑sentence description.
- **3.2 Revenue Estimation Agent:**
  • Estimate monthly revenue potential for each of the 10 streams using conservative GCC benchmarks.
  • Include assumptions and data sources as bullet notes.
- **3.3 Expense Estimation Agent:**
  • Estimate one‑time development cost and monthly OPEX for each.
  • Ensure validation cost ≤ $50 K; note all assumptions.

**4. Prioritize Top Streams**
- **Agent:** Prioritization Agent
- **Task:** Select the 3 streams with the highest ROI and validation feasibility under $50 K. Provide a 2‑sentence rationale each.

**5. Validation Strategy**
- **Agent:** Validation Agent
- **Task:** For each of the 3, outline an MVP validation plan: steps, success criteria, metrics, and an estimated validation budget (≤ $50 K).

**6. Pivot Implications**
- **Agent:** Pivot Agent
- **Task:** For each of the 3, state if it requires a business‑model pivot (e.g., B2C→B2B, one‑time vs. subscription) and draft the adjusted one‑sentence venture description.

---

**Format Instructions**
• Prefix each step with the agent name and step number.
• Use markdown tables for streams and concise bullet points for notes.
• Be concise, data‑driven, and conservative in all estimates.
```

### Defining the Agent Team

To create a more collaborative and multi-perspective approach, we asked ChatGPT to define a C-suite team:

```
If we need to build a multi-agent model, what agents do you suggest to have? and what is there roles.

Don't know if a real positions like available on Human world, or specific task agent looks better. but I prefere to have multiple agents from a different background to communicate and negotiate on each step rather than a single agent per task/step.

Negoiating and auditing, reviewing, enhancing in each step from different angels will consume more balance, but will absolutely give better results.

Give me a Chief level team that can manage a Venture Builder portfolio from different prespective.
```

This led to the creation of our nine specialized C-suite agents, each with distinct roles and expertise.

### Transitioning from Concept to Implementation

While ChatGPT was excellent for conceptual development and prompt engineering, we decided to transition to Claude for the technical implementation phase. This decision was based on several factors:

1. **Code Generation Capabilities**: Claude demonstrated strong capabilities in generating coherent, multi-file applications
2. **Context Window**: Claude's larger context window allowed us to work with more code at once
3. **Complementary Strengths**: Using different AI systems at different stages leveraged their respective strengths

This multi-model approach proved effective, with ChatGPT excelling at the conceptual and prompt engineering phases, while Claude handled the technical implementation.

## Implementation with Claude

With the master prompt and agent team defined through ChatGPT, we moved to Claude 3.7 Sonnet for the technical implementation phase. Claude's capabilities in understanding complex code structures and generating coherent multi-file applications made it well-suited for this task.

### Development Approach

The technical implementation followed these general steps:

1. **Architecture Planning**: We discussed the overall structure of the application, deciding to use CrewAI as the framework for orchestrating the multi-agent system.

2. **Component Design**: We defined the key components needed:
   - Agent definitions with specialized roles and backstories
   - Task definitions with stage-gating
   - Workshop flow control
   - Output formatting and reporting

3. **Iterative Implementation**: Rather than generating the entire application at once, we built it piece by piece:
   - First implementing the basic agent and task structure
   - Then adding the workshop flow logic
   - Later enhancing with features like the Workshop Historian

4. **Refinement and Enhancement**: Based on testing results, we made several key improvements:
   - Added step-by-step reporting to provide real-time visibility
   - Created the Workshop Historian agent to document the process
   - Simplified the event handling to focus on core functionality

5. **Documentation and Cleanup**: Finally, we improved documentation, removed unused code, and prepared the project for public sharing.

This approach allowed us to maintain control over the development process while leveraging Claude's capabilities for code generation and problem-solving.

## Key Prompting Techniques

### 1. Clear Problem Definition

When starting the project, I provided a detailed description of what I wanted to build:

```
I want to develop an AI application that implements a multi-agent monetization workshop system for early-stage ventures in the GCC/MENA region, with specific C-suite agent roles and a six-step workshop process.
```

This clear definition helped the AI understand the scope and purpose of the application.

### 2. Iterative Development

Rather than trying to generate the entire application at once, I used an iterative approach:

1. First, we established the basic structure and agent roles
2. Then we implemented the core workshop flow
3. Later we added enhanced features like the Workshop Historian
4. Finally, we improved the reporting and documentation

### 3. Specific Feedback and Refinement

When something wasn't working as expected, I provided specific feedback:

```
I don't need to get only the events, I need to see the details steps the agents take step by step.

Also, we need to modify the code to not only provide the final outcomes of the workshop, but the detailed research and report that shows the outcome of each step, with a little bit details about the descussion between the different agents.
```

This specific feedback helped the AI understand exactly what needed to be improved.

### 4. Technical Guidance When Needed

For complex technical issues, I provided more specific guidance:

```
Let's delete anything related to the logger, and only keep the step by step reporting from the new agents to the markdown file directly.
```

This helped overcome technical challenges when the AI's initial approach wasn't working.

## Example Prompts

Here are some example prompts that were particularly effective:

### Initial Project Definition

```
I want to develop an AI application that implements a multi-agent monetization workshop system for early-stage ventures in the GCC/MENA region. The system should include nine specialized C-suite agents (CSO, CFO, CTO, CPO, CMIO, CXDO, COO, CDAO, CPNO) that collaborate through a six-step workshop process:

1. Define Venture Description
2. Generate High-Level Streams (20 options)
3. Detail Realistic Streams (10 options)
4. Prioritize Top Streams (3 options)
5. Validation Strategy
6. Pivot Implications

The system should ensure all monetization streams meet regional constraints and early-stage funding limitations ($50K validation, $5K/month OPEX).
```

### Adding Enhanced Features

```
We need to modify the code to not only provide the final outcomes of the workshop, but the detailed research and report that shows the outcome of each step, with details about the discussion between the different agents.

Maybe we need a special agent to write these details as a MoM where agents need to signoff and agreed on its result.
```

### Fixing Technical Issues

```
The output md file is nearly empty, seems that the final reports are not recorded well. I think we don't need to wait for the full workshop to report, maybe we need to create the report after each step by updating the readme file.
```

## Best Practices Learned

1. **Be Specific**: Clearly define what you want to build and the problem you're trying to solve
2. **Iterate**: Build the application in stages rather than all at once
3. **Provide Context**: Give the AI enough background information about your domain
4. **Test Early and Often**: Identify issues quickly and address them
5. **Simplify When Needed**: Sometimes a simpler approach works better than a complex one
6. **Leverage AI Strengths**: Use AI for generating boilerplate code and creative solutions
7. **Guide Technical Decisions**: Provide direction on technical approaches when needed

## Conclusion

The development of the Venture Monetization Workshop represents a fascinating case study in human-AI collaboration. The process began with a real-world workshop, which was then transformed into a digital experience through careful prompt engineering and iterative refinement.

Key insights from this process include:

1. **Visual Context is Powerful**: Starting with a visual representation (MIRO board) gave the AI a comprehensive understanding of the workshop structure.

2. **Human Feedback Loop**: The management team's feedback was crucial in refining the AI's approach to match real-world constraints and regional considerations.

3. **Iterative Prompt Development**: The master prompt evolved through multiple iterations, becoming increasingly specific and constraint-focused.

4. **Multi-Agent Collaboration**: Moving from task-specific agents to a C-suite team with diverse perspectives created a more robust and realistic workshop experience.

5. **Implementation Flexibility**: The technical implementation evolved based on real-time feedback, with simpler approaches often proving more effective than complex ones.

This project demonstrates that complex business processes can be effectively translated into AI applications when there's a thoughtful balance between human guidance and AI capabilities. The result is not just a simulation of the original workshop, but an enhanced experience that incorporates domain expertise, regional constraints, and practical business considerations.

By following the prompting techniques and development approach outlined in this document, you can effectively leverage AI assistants for your own complex business applications, creating tools that augment human expertise rather than simply attempting to replace it.
